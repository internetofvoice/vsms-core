# Voice Skill Management System (Core)

> A framework aiming at the rapid development of custom interactions (skills) for voice assistant systems.
 
## About
This library is part of the Voice Skill Management System, or VSMS for short. 

VSMS is a skill development framework for voice assistants such as Amazon Voice Service. The intention is to speed up 
development by incorporating boilerplate code into a framework. VSMS is preconfigured to run multiple skills
as well as serving HTML content.    

## Usage
Please head over to the [VSMS-Skeleton](https://github.com/internetofvoice/vsms-skeleton)
to start developing your voice assistant skills. 

VSMS-Skeleton is an application skeleton based on this library and the Slim Framework 
which will help you to get started with voice assistant development.

## Development
VSMS aims to interact with multiple voice assistant systems, so it's not only nailed down to Amazon Voice Service. 
With more services popping up, VSMS will be extended to support those too. The idea is to have a single environment 
to handle all your voice assistant development needs without writing duplicate code.
